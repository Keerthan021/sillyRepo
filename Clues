In the earth, I take my silent stand,
Flexible and strong, in forests grand.
Tall and slender, a grass in disguise,
I sway with the wind, under open skies.
What am I, a natural pillar, unbowed,
In the green kingdom, where I'm avowed?

A: Bamboo 


I'm firm and unyielding, no cushioned grace, Not wood or metal, my structure is tough, Three companions find their place about, just sturdy and cold, where stories unfold?

A: The garden bench


In a realm of sheets, where whispers weave,
Echoes hum as dreams they conceive.
No hues of color, just monochrome art,
I mimic the light, a rhythmic heart.
Day and night, I mirror the sight,
In this realm where copies take flight.

A: The xerox shop


I rise above, a slender sentinel's grace,
Guiding the night with a steady embrace.
Wired veins carry the current's might,
A beacon in darkness, standing upright.
What structure am I, in the urban sprawl,
Where shadows dance as the night does fall?

A: Light pole



I stand in brilliance where success is seen,
A towering canvas of careers, bright and keen.
Bold and still, catching every gaze,
Silent herald of achievements in a corporate maze.
What am I, with grand portrayals untold,
On the campus side, where futures unfold?

A: Placement billboard.


In the realm where hunger's whispers wend,
A sanctuary where flavors and tables blend.
Pots, like ancient cauldrons, a culinary dream,
Cravings find solace in a time-honored stream.
What am I, a gastronomic haven serene,
In the tapestry of campus life, a culinary scene?

A: Canteen


In the realm of roars, the mechanical art, I forge the essence that sets worlds apart. Not sun nor wind, yet a power unseen, In circuits and wires, I reign supreme. What am I, the architect of surging might, crafting energy's light?

A: Power generator
